# Game-Theoretic Machine Learning

In this project, we provide a general framework of machine learning problems, 
which can be viewed as games between multiple players. 
1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): CV
2. Adversarial Training (AT): CV/NLP
3. Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO): NLP
4. Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL): RL
