# Game-Theoretic Machine Learning

In this project, we provide a general framework of machine learning problems, 
which can be viewed as games between multiple players. 
1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
2. Adversarial Training (AT)
3. Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)
4. Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL)
